# bedrock-bypass
a simple patch for minecraft bedrock to join java servers and behave like mc java version. currently only supporting 1.17 and there are no plans for 1.17.1 but i'll surely make for 1.18 later. also theres option for fabric 1.17 mc if you want optimization mods n stuff.

# how to install vanilla patch?
- download release mc_va-1.17.zip
- exxtract the zip and move the bypass-java-va.pl to %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang
- boot up your mc and force close with task manager.
- open again and enjoy the java taste ;)

# how to install fabric patch?
- download release mc_fa-1.17.zip
- exxtract the zip and move the bypass-java=fa.pl to %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang and create a folder named ".fabric" and put the file in it.
- then in %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang, create a new folder named "mods-fa" and put fabric mods there. [Note: fabric api is required.]
- boot up your mc and force close with task manager.
- open again and enjoy the java taste ;)

# Final words
